# LiniTunes
Acronym for : LiniTunes is not iTunes

The aim of this project is to give Linux users (maybe Windows and macOS as well) a GUI app to manage their iDevice.
After that, the goal is to add the ability to listen to their music with Apple Music (maybe)

This will use lots of open-source project, and since I'm new to GUI app on Linux, I need to learn.
I use Qt6+QML for this project.
If you want to contribute, you can open an issue, a request, a suggestion, or submit a pool request.

This project is in its early developments. Everything could change at any time given.
