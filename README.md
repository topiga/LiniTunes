# LiniTunes
Acronym for : LiniTunes is not iTunes

The aim of this project is to give Linux users a GUI app to : 
- Manage their iDevice
- Listen to their music with Apple Music
- And more if I have the time

This will use lots of open-source project, and since I'm new to GUI app on Linux, I'll need to learn.
I plan to use Qt+QML for this project.
